# Automated Lie Detection

This project provides an interface for assessing the credibility of autobiographical statements.

## Technical Overview

The application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to submit statements of any length and receive real-time feedback. A pretrained DistilBERT model powers the predictions, determining whether a statement is likely true or false, along with how confident the model is in its prediction.

## Intended Use

The model is specifically trained on autobiographical statements. As such, this tool is designed to evaluate the credibility of personal narratives, such as stories shared in casual conversations.
